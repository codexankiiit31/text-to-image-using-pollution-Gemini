# üé® AI Text-to-Image Generator with Prompt Enhancement

A powerful and intuitive web application that transforms simple text ideas into stunning, high-quality images. This project uses a sophisticated two-step AI pipeline: **Google Gemini** enhances your basic prompt into a detailed, artistic description, and then **Pollinations.ai** generates a beautiful image based on that enhanced prompt.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Smart Prompt Enhancement**: Leverages Google Gemini to automatically enrich simple user prompts with cinematic and artistic details.
* **High-Quality Image Generation**: Utilizes the Pollinations.ai API to produce visually appealing images.
* **Rich Style Presets**: Choose from a variety of styles, including Photorealistic, Anime, Watercolor, and Cyberpunk.
* **Customizable Output**: Control the number of images, quality level, and aspect ratio (1:1, 16:9, 9:16).
* **Intuitive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a clean, fast, and user-friendly experience.
* **Easy to Download**: Instantly download your generated creations with a single click.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application follows a simple yet powerful two-stage process to ensure the highest quality output from a basic input.

`User Input (e.g., "a cat in a library")`
‚ûî `ü§ñ Step 1: Gemini Prompt Enhancer` ‚ûî `Enhanced Prompt (e.g., "A cinematic, photorealistic shot of a fluffy calico cat...")`
‚ûî `üé® Step 2: Pollinations.ai Image Generator` ‚ûî `üñºÔ∏è Final Image Output`

1.  **Prompt Enhancement**: The initial prompt, along with the selected style and quality settings, is sent to a Google Gemini model via LangChain. Gemini acts as an expert "prompt engineer," expanding the simple idea into a rich, descriptive paragraph suitable for an advanced image model.
2.  **Image Generation**: The newly enhanced prompt is then passed to the Pollinations.ai API, which renders the final image(s) based on this detailed description.
